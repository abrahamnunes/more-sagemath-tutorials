   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

More Sage Thematic Tutorials
============================

This is a repository of `SageMath <http://sagemath.org>`_
demonstrations, quick reference cards, primers, and thematic
tutorials, grouped by theme, and licensed under a
`Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License`__.

- A *demonstration* is a short document giving a broad view of the
  available features on a given theme; it is typically presented
  during a talk, and lasts a couple minutes.

- A *quickref* (or quick reference card) is a one page document with
  the essential examples, and pointers to the main entry points.

- A *primer* is a document meant for a user to get started by himself
  on a theme in a matter of minutes.

- A *tutorial* is more in-depth and could take as much as an hour or
  more to get through.

This repository is meant as a place to collectively share and evolve
documents for `SageMath <http://sagemath.org>`_ with the aim to merge
the mature ones into Sage's official documentation, and in particular
its `official thematic tutorials <http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/index.html>`_.
For the convenience of the reader, the index below also includes links
to some of the latter.

Some documents are related to special events: :ref:`talks`.

Contributions are more than welcome. See the
`README <https://github.com/nthiery/sage-thematic-tutorials/blob/master/README.rst>`_
on the `project's repository <https://github.com/sagemath/more-thematic-tutorials>`_.
