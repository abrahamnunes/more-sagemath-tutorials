Computational sessions at the CRM thematic semester: Algebra and Words in Combinatorics
=======================================================================================

.. MODULEAUTHOR:: Nicolas M. Thi√©ry <nthiery at users.sf.net>

Computer exploration has proven to be an effective tool while carrying
research in algebra and combinatorics. To support this, researchers
around the world have implemented many features and shared them in
systems like GAP, Magma, or SageMath. Quite a few of those researchers
are participating to the CRM semester on
`Algebra and Words in Combinatorics <http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/act/theme/theme_2017_1_en/index.php>`_
and happy to share their expertise. To this end we are running regular
informal computational sessions during the schools and workshops.

There are no prerequisites to attend the sessions. If possible, bring
your laptop. This page contains some material for those sessions.

Schools and workshops
=====================

- :ref:`crm.2017.equivariant-combinatorics`

Software
========

`Sagemath <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_ and `GAP
<https://www.gap-system.org/>`_ are open source, and can be used
online. For regular use, we recommend installing them on your computer
and are happy to give a hand. `Magma <http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/>`_
can be used online for small calculations. Installing it require a
license.

- The `SageMath cell server <http://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJwrKMrMK1Fwzq9ILUktci_KLy3QiFZyVdKxiNXUS04sSsnMS8zJLKnU0OTl4uXyUbBVCMrPLwmuLC5JzQUqdFfSMdIxBCpNzE3KTM0riS8uSExOBSn20SvIyS8BsQAl4R4v&lang=sage>`_ for simple calculations
- `Cocalc <https://cocalc.org>`_: a full featured computational
  environment with Sage, GAP and many other software
- The `Magma calculator <http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/>`_
- `CHAMP: A CHerednik Algebra Magma Package <https://thielul.github.io/CHAMP/>`_
