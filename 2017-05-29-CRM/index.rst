CRM school and workshop: Algebraic and Geometric Combinatorics of Reflection Groups
================================================================================================

.. MODULEAUTHOR:: Nicolas M. Thi√©ry <nthiery at users.sf.net>

Computer exploration has proven to be an effective tool while carrying
research around reflection groups. To support this, researchers around
the world have implemented many features and shared them in systems
like GAP, Magma, or SageMath.

Quite a few of those researchers will be among the participants of the
`Algebraic and Geometric Combinatorics of Reflection Groups
<http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2017/Reflexion17/index_e.php>`_ school
and workshop, and happy to share their expertise. To this end we will
run informal computational sessions every afternoon after the main
courses. This page contains some material for those sessions.

`Sagemath <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_ and `GAP <https://www.gap-system.org/>`_ are open source, and can be used online:

- The `SageMath cell server <http://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJwrKMrMK1Fwzq9ILUktci_KLy3QiFZyVdKxiNXUS04sSsnMS8zJLKnU0OTl4uXyUbBVCMrPLwmuLC5JzQUqdFfSMdIxBCpNzE3KTM0riS8uSExOBSn20SvIyS8BsQAl4R4v&lang=sage>`_ for simple calculations

- `Cocalc <https://cocalc.org>`_ for a full featured computational environment

For regular use, we recommend installing them on your computer and are
happy to give a hand.
